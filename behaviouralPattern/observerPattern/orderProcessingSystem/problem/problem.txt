Problem:
 You are tasked with designing an order processing system for an e-commerce platform. 
 Whenever an orderâ€™s status changes (for example, from 'pending' to 'shipped'), multiple
  components must react. The shipping service needs to prepare the package, the billing 
  service needs to charge the customer, and the inventory service needs to update stock 
  levels. Problem: How would you structure the order processing system and its related 
  components so that each module automatically receives updates about order status changes, 
  while ensuring that the Order component remains decoupled from those modules?
