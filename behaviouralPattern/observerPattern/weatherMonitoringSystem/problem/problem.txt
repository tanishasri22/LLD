 Question:
 You are designing a simple weather monitoring system. A WeatherData component tracks the 
 current temperature and humidity. Several display elements (such as a desktop dashboard 
 and a mobile app) should automatically update whenever the weather data changes. 
 Problem: How would you design the relationship between the WeatherData component and the 
 display elements so that the displays are notified of changes without the WeatherData 
 component being tightly coupled to the display implementations?
