1. Basic (Understanding the Pattern)
Problem Statement:
 You are designing a media player application that supports playing, pausing, and stopping
 a song. Each of these states changes the behavior of the player (e.g., pressing "play" 
 while playing does nothing, pressing "pause" while stopped is invalid).

 Question:
 How would you use the State Design Pattern to manage the transitions and behavior of the
 media player across different states?
