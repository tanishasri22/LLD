Basic Scenario â€“
 Payment Processing: You are developing an e-commerce platform that must support multiple 
 payment methods (credit card, PayPal, and cryptocurrency). The payment processing logic 
 should allow adding new payment options in the future without modifying existing code.
 How would you design the payment component using the Strategy pattern to accommodate 
 this requirement and enable selecting a payment strategy at runtime?
