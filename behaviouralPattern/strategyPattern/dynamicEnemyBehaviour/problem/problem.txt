Advanced Scenario â€“ 
 Dynamic Enemy Behavior: 
 In a video game, enemy characters can adopt various attack behaviors (such as ranged, melee,
 or stealth) and may switch their strategy based on the game state. For example, an enemy 
 might start with a stealth strategy and switch to a ranged strategy when the player comes 
 into view. How would you apply the Strategy pattern to implement this dynamically changeable
 behavior for enemy AI?
