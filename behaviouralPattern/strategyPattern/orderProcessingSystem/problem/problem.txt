Expert Scenario â€“
 Refactoring for Extendability: You are refactoring an order processing system that 
 currently applies discounts using a series of conditional statements for different discount 
 types (seasonal, promotional, clearance, etc.). The system must follow the Open/Closed 
 Principle so new discount strategies can be added without modifying existing code. How can 
 the Strategy pattern be applied in this scenario to redesign the discount application mechanism 
 for better maintainability and ease of extension?
