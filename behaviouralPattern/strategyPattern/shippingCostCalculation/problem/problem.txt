Intermediate Scenario â€“ 
 Shipping Cost Calculation: 
 In a logistics system, you need to calculate shipping costs based on different algorithms 
 depending on the shipping method (standard, express, overnight, etc.). The company frequently 
 adds new carriers with unique cost calculations, and the user should be able to choose the shipping 
 strategy at checkout. How would you structure the shipping cost calculator using the 
 Strategy pattern so that new shipping algorithms can be added without altering existing code?
