Question:
 Implement an Abstract Factory for a Notification System that supports:
 1. Email and SMS notifications
 2. Works on AWS and Firebase as backends

The factory should allow switching between backends without changing client code.

Concepts Covered:
 âœ” Handling different implementations for platforms.
 âœ” Abstract Factory with external dependencies (push notifications, emails).
 âœ” How Abstract Factory ensures code flexibility.

Extension:
Convert this into a Singleton Factory to ensure only one instance of each notification service exists.

ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:
 NotificationFactory factory = new AwsNotificationFactory();
 EmailSender emailSender = factory.createEmailSender();
 emailSender.send("Hello from AWS SES!");
