Question:
 Design an Abstract Factory to create UI components (Button and Checkbox) for 
 different operating systems (Windows and MacOS). Each OS should have its own 
 implementation of Button and Checkbox.

Concepts Covered:
 ✔ Families of related objects (buttons & checkboxes for different OS).
 ✔ Encapsulating object creation inside factories.
 ✔ Decoupling client code from specific implementations.

Extension:
 Implement a Factory Method Pattern inside each concrete factory to further 
 separate object creation.
