Question:
    Design a Builder Pattern for creating a House object with the following attributes:
        rooms (integer, optional)
        windows (integer, optional)
        hasGarage (boolean, optional)
        hasSwimmingPool (boolean, optional)

    The builder should:
    ✔ Allow step-by-step construction of a House object.
    ✔ Prevent inconsistent object creation (e.g., a house with a garage but no rooms).
    ✔ Ensure the final object is immutable after construction.

Extension:
Modify the builder to support method chaining (Fluent Interface).
