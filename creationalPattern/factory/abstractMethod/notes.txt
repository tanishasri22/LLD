General Rule to Decide: "Product vs. Variant" Pattern

Use this general identification method:
Interfaces represent the product types (what you are creating).
Factories represent the families of products (i.e., a group of related variants that work together).

What you’re looking at      | Ask this question                                    | Result
A category/type of object   | “What kinds of things do I create?”                  | → Interface (Product)
A variation/set of products | “Which environment or config decides the variation?” | → Factory (Family of Products)

UI Widget Factory:
Types: Button, Checkbox (→ interfaces)
Variants: MacOS, Windows (→ factories)

🔁 Summary:
Interfaces → types of product (what we're creating)
Factories → groupings/variants of those products (the environment in which we're creating)
