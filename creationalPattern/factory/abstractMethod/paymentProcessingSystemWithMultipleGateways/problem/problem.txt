Question:
 Create an Abstract Factory to support different payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe). Each payment
 gateway should have its own CreditCardProcessor and UPIProcessor implementation.
Concepts Covered:
 âœ” How Abstract Factory extends Factory Method.
 âœ” Encapsulating multiple related object creations (different payment gateways).
 âœ” Using Abstract Factory in real-world applications.
Extension:
 Use the Strategy Pattern to dynamically select the payment processor at runtime.
ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:
 PaymentGatewayFactory factory = new PayPalFactory();
 CreditCardProcessor ccProcessor = factory.createCreditCardProcessor();
 ccProcessor.process(100.0);
