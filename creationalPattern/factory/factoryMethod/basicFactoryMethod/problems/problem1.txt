1. Basic Factory Method Implementation
Question:
Implement a Factory Method Pattern for creating different types of 
payments (CreditCardPayment, DebitCardPayment, UPIPayment).

Define a common Payment interface with a method processPayment(amount: float).
Create concrete classes implementing this interface.
Implement a PaymentFactory interface with a createPaymentMethod() factory method.
Provide subclasses (CreditCardFactory, DebitCardFactory, UPIFactory) that override
createPaymentMethod().


Concept Covered:

Basic Factory Method structure with subclass responsibility.
Decoupling object creation from client code.


Extension:

Convert it into an Abstract Factory Pattern where a PaymentServiceFactory 
provides additional services like getPaymentGateway().
