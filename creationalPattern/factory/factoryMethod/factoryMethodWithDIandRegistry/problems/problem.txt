Factory Method with Dependency Injection & Registry
Question:
 1. Create a Factory Method Pattern to generate analytics engines (GoogleAnalytics, Mixpanel, 
    Segment). Each engine should implement an Analytics interface with a method trackEvent
    (event: string).
 2. Instead of hardcoding, use a Registry-Based Factory where new analytics engines can be 
    registered dynamically at runtime.

Concept Covered:
 1. Using Dependency Injection with Factory Method.
 2. Implementing a Registry-Based Factory for dynamic extensibility.

Extension:
 Extend this into a Prototype Pattern, allowing analytics engines to be cloned instead 
 of instantiated repeatedly.
