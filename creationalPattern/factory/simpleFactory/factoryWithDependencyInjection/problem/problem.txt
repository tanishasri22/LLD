Question:
 Implement a Logger Factory that provides different logging mechanisms 
 (ConsoleLogger, FileLogger, DatabaseLogger). The factory should allow injecting 
 dependencies (e.g., file path for FileLogger, database connection for DatabaseLogger).


Extension:
Extend this into a Singleton Factory, ensuring that only one instance of a particular 
logger type exists.
