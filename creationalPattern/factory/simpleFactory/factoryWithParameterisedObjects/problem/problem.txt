Question:
Enhance the vehicle factory so that each vehicle type can have additional attributes 
like speed and fuel type. Modify the factory method to accept these parameters and 
create vehicles with different configurations.

Extension:

Convert this into an Abstract Factory Pattern where we have a FuelVehicleFactory 
and ElectricVehicleFactory.
