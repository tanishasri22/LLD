Question:
 Create a Factory Method pattern for different database connections (PostgreSQLConnection, 
 MySQLConnection, MongoDBConnection).
    1. Define a DatabaseConnection interface with connect() and disconnect() methods.
    2. Implement concrete database classes.
    3. Create separate factory classes (PostgreSQLFactory, MySQLFactory, MongoDBFactory)
         that implement the factory method createConnection().

Concept Covered:
    Using multiple factory classes instead of a single one.
    Encouraging Open-Closed Principle (OCP).

Extension:
    Extend this into a Singleton Pattern ensuring only one connection instance per database.
