✅ Use Simple Factory → When object creation logic needs to be centralized but doesn't change 
    frequently.
✅ Use Factory Method → When you expect object creation logic to change, so subclasses can extend it.
✅ Use Abstract Factory → When multiple related objects need to be created together.

Analogy ->
factory method -> primitive datatype
abstract method -> class/struct datatype
