CONS of Simple Factory

Why Consider Changing the Simple Factory Approach?
1. Violation of Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

    In your simpleFactoryCreate method, if a new vehicle type (e.g., Bus) 
    is added, you must modify the factory method:
        ```else if (vehicle.compareTo("Bus") == 0)
            return new Bus();```
    This is a code smell because every time a new type is added, the factory class changes.
    This violates OCP since the class isn't closed for modification.

2. Scalability Issues
    If you have a growing number of vehicle types, the if-else conditions in 
    simpleFactoryCreate will become harder to manage.

3. Tight Coupling

    Your simpleFactory class knows about all the vehicle types (Car, Bike, Truck).
    This reduces flexibility and makes it harder to maintain.
