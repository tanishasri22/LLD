Question:
 Create a Singleton Logger class that writes logs to a file. Ensure:
    1. The Singleton instance is thread-safe.
    2. The logger can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

Concepts Covered:
 âœ” Handling concurrency in Singleton.
 âœ” Using synchronized vs. volatile for thread safety.
 âœ” Performance optimizations using Double-Checked Locking.
 
Extension:
 Implement a Factory Pattern to allow different types of loggers (FileLogger, ConsoleLogger).

ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:
 Logger logger = Logger.getInstance();
 logger.log("Application started");
