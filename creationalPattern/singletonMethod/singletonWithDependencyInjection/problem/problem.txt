Question:
 Design a Database Connection Pool as a Singleton. The pool should:
    1. Maintain a limited number of database connections.
    2. Allow clients to request and release connections.
    3. Be initialized only once across the application.

Concepts Covered:
 âœ” Singleton with resource management.
 âœ” Handling lazy loading and object pooling.
 âœ” Integration with Dependency Injection frameworks (like Spring).

Extension:
 Convert this into a Factory Pattern that creates connection objects dynamically.

ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:
 DatabaseConnectionPool pool = DatabaseConnectionPool.getInstance();
 Connection conn = pool.getConnection();
