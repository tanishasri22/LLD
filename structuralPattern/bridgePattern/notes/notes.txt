💡 Easy Rule:

“Abstraction” = What the user wants to do (e.g., send a message)
                -> with what user interacts with.

“Implementation” = How it gets done (e.g., send via Email, SMS, Push)
                -> what is needed to perform the abstraction

✅ “Abstraction” → What the user interacts with (e.g., Message interface).
It's the layer exposed to the client — defines high-level operations.

✅ “Implementation” → What is needed to perform the abstraction behind the scenes (e.g., NotificationSender).
It contains the platform-specific or technical logic to fulfill that behavior.
