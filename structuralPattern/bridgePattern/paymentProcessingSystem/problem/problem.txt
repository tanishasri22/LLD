Problem: 
 Design a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods (e.g., CreditCard, PayPal) and multiple payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPalGateway) Use the Bridge pattern to decouple payment methods from payment gatewas.

Objective: 
- Implement a PaymentMethod hierarcy.
- Implement a PaymentGateway hierarcy.
- Allow any payment  method to work with any payment gateway.

Key Concepts: - Decoupling abstraction (PaymentMethod) from implementation (PaymentGatewa).- Facilitating  independent development and extension of payment methods and gatewas.
