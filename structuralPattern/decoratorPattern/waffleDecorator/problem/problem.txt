Statement of Work
 Waffle Shop is a café that sells waffles . When customers arrive at this cafe, they design the 
 waffle they want according to the kinds of waffles, their ingredients and their prices. The 
 waitress delivers these orders to the cook from the customer. The cook is responsible for making 
 the waffle. We will prepare an order system in which we will check the company's waffle orders.
 We have to act with some problems in creating this system. For example, there is a waffle order
 from the customer. The customer wanted for a waffle with strawberry and white chocolate sauce.
 We need to expand the functionality of the class in a transparent and dynamic way. Here ,we will 
 pay attention to this.

Design Pattern(s)
 Decorator design pattern are applied for solving existing problems in the project. Decorator 
 pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in 
 an object of a decorator class. In real world, imagine you run a car service shop offering 
 multiple services. Now how do you calculate the bill to be charged? You pick one service and 
 dynamically keep adding to it the prices for the provided services till you get the final cost. 
 Here each type of service is a decorator.

 In my example, I am using decorator pattern because in waffle shop people comes and orders one 
 base waffle from our options and they are adding some fruits and sauces whatever they want. So
 I will create base waffle classes as ConcreteComponent and we will create decorators like 
 chocolate, fruits, sauce as ConcreteDecorator. For example, When I order a waffle, firstly I 
 pick dough of waffle. Then I’m adding Nutella chocolate on waffle dough and I’m choosing 
 fruits(like strawberry,bananas,pineapple). Then top of the waffle, I’m adding white chocolate 
 sauce and nut, almond pieces. It is ready! Mmm awesome.
