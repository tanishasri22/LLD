 Question 1: Basic Facade Implementation
Scenario:
 You're building a simple Home Theater system with multiple subsystems:
 a. Amplifier
 b. DVDPlayer
 c. Projector
 d. Lights

Task:
 Create a Facade class HomeTheaterFacade that provides high-level methods:
 watchMovie(movie: string)
 endMovie()

Let the facade internally call all relevant subsystem methods in the correct sequence.
