Virtual Proxy: Lazy Initialization
Problem: Youâ€™re creating a HighResolutionImage class that loads a high-res image from disk   (simulated by a delay).
 Design a proxy that loads the image only when it is actually needed (e.g., when display() is called).
Practice Concepts: Lazy loading, virtual proxy.
